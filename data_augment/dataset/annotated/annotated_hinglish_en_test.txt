Yes, I agree - it's good to show it, and good to make people uncomfortable, so they think about it and hopefully see what's wrong. I think my favorite scene is when Michael questions Leigh Anne (mother) about her motives for taking him in. It was an important conversation to have, and not an easy one, but ultimately Michael's okay w/ what she says - and it shows that he's finally feeling safe enough to have opinions about things.

That's true. Maybe some people didn't like that it was a white family helping a black boy? I'm not sure. I did like when they got Michael a tutor - she was outspoken and nice, so her personality added some fun to the goings-on.
